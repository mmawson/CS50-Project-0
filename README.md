Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project contains photos of carpentry work done by my friend John.
index.html has an introduction and photo of my house
Other .html files have painting, refurbishment, and landscaping photos
Finally, there is a selfie of John and myself in the selfie.html file

To be sure I met the requirements I went point by point in the requirements section of project0.html

Bootstrap 4 is linked in every .html file
My stylesheet is special.css  It has all the markup specified in the requirements
Finally I made a ./sass directory and JohnCarpenter.scss file which I compiled in JohnCarpenter.css in the same directory.  I linked to it only in selfies.html

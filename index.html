		<h4>This is my house.  It was well builtin 1942.<br>
			 	It has suffered neglect by the last owners<br>
			  I am restoring it; painting, landscaping, and refurbishing/replacing the damaged wood.<br>
				Click the links below and take a look at my work.<br>
				I have posted the before and after photos.<br>
				I never cut corners because I believe that a job done right means less work in the long run.<br>
				Plese feel free to contact me about your own refurbishment projects<br>
